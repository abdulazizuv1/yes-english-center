# Username Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented username functionality for the YES English Center platform. Users can now log in with usernames instead of emails, and existing users will be prompted to add their full name upon login.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes

#### A. Main Page (`index.html`)
- **Updated Login Panel**: Changed email input placeholder from "Username (email)" to "Username"
- **Added Username Setup Panel**: New modal panel that appears for users without a name set
  - Simple form with name input field
  - Glass morphism styling to match existing design
  - Required field validation

#### B. Styling (`style.css`)
- Added CSS for `.username_panel` and `.username-setup` classes
- Matches existing login panel styling with glass morphism effects
- Higher z-index (125) to ensure it appears above other elements

#### C. Authentication Module (`src/modules/auth/auth.js`)
Added new functions:
- `getEmailFromUsername()`: Queries Firestore to find email from username
- `updateUserName()`: Updates user's name in Firestore
- `hasValidName()`: Checks if user has a valid name (not "No name")
- Updated `login()`: Now supports both username and email login
  - Automatically detects if input is username (no @) or email
  - Queries Firestore to find email for username
  - Falls back to email-based login if @ symbol is present

#### D. Authentication UI Module (`src/modules/auth/auth-ui.js`)
Added new functions:
- `showUsernamePanel()`: Displays the username setup modal
- `hideUsernamePanel()`: Hides the username setup modal
- `clearUsernameForm()`: Clears the username input field
- `initUsernameForm()`: Initializes form handlers for username submission

#### E. Main Application (`src/main.js`)
- Updated `initializeAuth()` to check for valid username after login
- Automatically shows username setup panel if user has "No name"
- Initializes username form handlers
- Updated login handler to accept username or email

### 2. Admin Panel Changes

#### A. Admin HTML (`settings/admin/index.html`)
- Added two new input fields to user creation form:
  - Username field (unique identifier)
  - Full Name field (user's real name)
- Both fields are required when creating new users

#### B. Admin JavaScript (`settings/admin/index.js`)
- Updated `callCreateUser()`: Now sends username and name to Cloud Function
- Updated form submission handler: Validates username and name fields
- Shows error if username or name is missing

### 3. Backend Changes

#### Cloud Functions (`functions/index.js`)
- Updated `createUser` function to accept `username` and `name` parameters
- Added username uniqueness validation:
  - Checks if username already exists in Firestore
  - Returns error if duplicate username found
- Saves username and name to user document in Firestore

## Database Schema

### User Document Structure (Firestore)
```javascript
{
  email: "user@example.com",           // User's email (required)
  role: "student",                     // User role: student/admin/teacher (required)
  name: "John Doe",                    // User's full name (required)
  username: "johndoe"                  // Unique username for login (optional but recommended)
}
```

### Notes:
- `username` field is optional for backward compatibility
- If no username is set, user can still log in with email
- If username is provided, it must be unique across all users
- `name` defaults to "No name" for existing users (prompts them to update)

## User Flow

### For New Users (Created by Admin)
1. Admin creates user account with username, name, email, password, and role
2. User receives credentials from teacher
3. User logs in using their username (not email)
4. User gains access to mock tests

### For Existing Users (Without Name Set)
1. User logs in with email or username
2. System detects user has "No name" in their profile
3. Username setup panel appears automatically
4. User enters their full name
5. Name is saved to Firestore
6. User can continue using the platform

### For Login
- Users can now log in with either:
  - **Username**: System looks up email from username, then authenticates
  - **Email**: Direct authentication (backward compatible)
- System automatically detects which format user entered

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy Cloud Functions
```bash
cd functions
npm install  # If any new dependencies were added
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### 2. Verify Deployment
- Check that `createUser` function updated successfully
- Test creating a new user with username and name fields

### 3. Test the Implementation

#### Test 1: Username Setup for Existing Users
1. Log in with an existing account that has "No name"
2. Verify username setup panel appears
3. Enter a full name and submit
4. Verify panel closes and name is saved in Firestore

#### Test 2: Login with Username
1. Create a new user with username "testuser"
2. Log out
3. Try logging in with username "testuser" (not email)
4. Verify login is successful

#### Test 3: Admin User Creation
1. Go to admin panel
2. Create a new user with all fields:
   - Username: unique identifier
   - Full Name: user's real name
   - Email: user's email
   - Password: user's password
   - Role: student/admin
3. Verify user is created successfully
4. Try logging in with the new username

## Security Considerations

1. **Username Uniqueness**: Cloud Function validates username uniqueness before creating user
2. **Admin-Only Access**: Only admins can create users with usernames
3. **Authentication**: Username login still uses secure Firebase Authentication
4. **Data Privacy**: User names are stored securely in Firestore with proper security rules

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Allow users to change their username (requires admin approval)
2. Add username validation (alphanumeric, length limits, etc.)
3. Add profile page where users can view/edit their information
4. Add username search in admin panel
5. Export user list with usernames for reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Username setup panel doesn't appear
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify user document in Firestore has `name: "No name"`
- Clear cache and reload page

### Issue: Can't log in with username
- Verify username exists in Firestore user document
- Check that `username` field is indexed in Firestore
- Try logging in with email to verify account exists

### Issue: "Username already exists" error
- Username must be unique across all users
- Check Firestore for existing user with that username
- Choose a different username

## Files Modified

1. `/index.html` - Added username setup panel
2. `/style.css` - Added username panel styling
3. `/src/modules/auth/auth.js` - Added username authentication logic
4. `/src/modules/auth/auth-ui.js` - Added username UI handlers
5. `/src/main.js` - Integrated username checking
6. `/settings/admin/index.html` - Added username/name fields
7. `/settings/admin/index.js` - Updated user creation logic
8. `/functions/index.js` - Updated Cloud Function for username support

## Firestore Index Required

You may need to create a composite index in Firestore for efficient username queries:

**Collection**: `users`
**Fields indexed**: `username` (Ascending)

Firebase will prompt you to create this index if needed when you first try to query by username.
