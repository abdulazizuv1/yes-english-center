          "text": "Tuatara are lizard-like reptiles, found only in New Zealand. They are representative of ancient life forms. Tuatara are the only living representatives of an ancient lineage of reptiles called Sphenodontia, which is over 250 million years old. Because tuatara still look like fossils of reptiles that lived during the age of dinosaurs, they are often called living fossils. Now just two species of tuatara survive, and only in New Zealand. One is the Brothers Island tuatara which, until recent re-introductions to sanctuaries (safe places for wildlife), only survived on North Brother Island. The other species is the common tuatara, which survives on many other offshore islands. Although the tuatara species appear similar, they have genetic differences. Tuatara bones have been found in many parts of New Zealand. Where dated, they are usually a few hundred to 5,000 years old. It is not known whether these bones are from the two living species or other species that are now extinct.\n\nMany anatomical features distinguish tuatara from other living reptiles - for example, they have a defining pattern of openings in the skull and a unique type of haemoglobin in the blood, and males have no external reproductive organ. Adults are between 30 and 75 centimetres long, and weigh between 250 and 1,200 grams. Males are larger than females, and have more developed spines in the crest along the neck, back and tail.\n\nThe male tuatara courts the female by approaching her with a proud walk. Tuatara mate in late summer, and the female usually lays 6-10 eggs the following spring, in a shallow nest at ground level. She may guard the nest for a few nights, then return to her burrow underground. The eggs incubate for about a year, so hatchlings emerge about the time that eggs are being laid the following season. Evidence indicates the gender of tuatara hatchlings is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. It is said that it is more likely for warmer eggs to produce male tuatara, and cooler eggs to produce females. The hatchlings receive no parental care and need to find their own food.\n\nTuatara live for a relatively long time, reaching reproductive maturity at about 15 years, and may breed for many decades. Their maximum lifespan is not known for certain, but many tuatara have reached 80 years still looking vigorous and healthy. Tuatara live in underground burrows and are more active at night, but will come out during the day to bask in the sun. Both sexes are territorial, and males aggressively defend their territory by posing and fighting if necessary. Teeth are their main weapons, and a bite can cause serious injury. Tuatara are carnivorous, eating invertebrates, lizards and the baby seabirds with which they often share burrows.\n\nTuatara were once widespread and abundant on the New Zealand mainland, but when Polynesian settlers arrived in New Zealand, in about 1250-1300 AD, they brought with them Pacific rats which killed tuatara. By the time of European settlement, in the 1840s, tuatara were almost extinct on the New Zealand mainland. Some islands provided temporary havens, but soon these too began to be invaded by rats and other mammalian predators.\n\nGradually tuatara became restricted to 32 nearshore islands. Many of these islands were tiny, some as small as only one hectare. A few, such as the Poor Knights common tuatara lives on islands off the north-eastern coast of New Zealand, and on some islands in Cook Strait. The Brothers Island tuatara survived only on the of the Brothers Island tuatara have been created on Titi Island in the Marlborough Sounds, and on Somes Island in Wellington Harbour.\n\nTuatara can live in remarkably dense populations. Most tuatara islands have 50-100 tuatara per square hectare – so an island of only 10 hectares may have a population of hundreds. Larger islands with many seabirds and invertebrates, which tuatara eat, may have greater densities. The largest population is on Stephens Island, where there are estimated to be as many as 2,500 per hectare in some places, and a total of at least 30,000. The total number of tuatara on all the islands is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.\n\nLegal protection was granted to tuatara and the islands they occupied in 1895, but the reptiles continued to decline. Since then, active conservation management has reversed the decline, and new populations have become established on predator-free islands. In the mid-1980s the New Zealand Wildlife Service and its successor, the Department of Conservation, developed ways to eradicate rats from islands. Rats have now gone from almost all of the tuatara islands, making them safe for many threatened native species. In addition, the collection by conservationists of eggs for incubation in captivity, breeding in captivity, and moving tuatara to rat-Islands off the Northland coast, or Stephens Island in Cook Strait, were never invaded by rats, and had few of the other mammals that threaten native animals. The tiny, 4 hectare North Brother Island, in Cook Strait. However, two new populations free islands, have increased the number of islands that are inhabited by tuatara to 37. Many new tuatara populations are planned for islands and mainland reserves that have been freed of predators.",

          "title": "The Tasmanian Tiger",
          "instructions": "You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.",
          "text": "The Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, was a carnivorous marsupial (a meat-eating mammal which carries its young in a pouch). It was given the name \"tiger\" because it had striped fur, and because it was ferocious. Between 24 million and 15 million years ago, many types of thylacine roamed across Australia, their powerful jaws playing a role in maintaining a balance in the ecosystems of their day. Some species were fox sized, while others were barely the size of kittens.\n\nBut when a period of climate change cooled Australia about 12 million years ago, the numbers of these ancient thylacines began to decline. By about 3 million years ago, only one species was left. About 4,000 years ago, these vanished completely Australia, was then the last remaining place where thylacines existed. They ruled the animal life of that island unchallenged until Europeans with sheep, dogs, and a great indifferent to native flora and fauna, seem to have brought about their extinction. In 1936, the last captive Tasmanian bush, but no definitive evidence has been found. Despite this, there are many who keep searching.\n\nIn 1981 Dutch-born zoologist Hans Naarding was in Tasmania conducting a survey of Latham's snipe, a species of endangered bird. One night he saw an animal in the light from the searchlight mounted on his vehicle. He described as about the size of a large dog, but with slightly sloping hindquarters and a fairly thick tail continuing straight on from its backbone. He said that it had 12 distinct stripes on its back, running down to the point where the tail began. He reported the sighting to the Director of Tasmania's National Parks. When the news broke, said Naarding, 'I was besieged by television crews, including four or five from Japan, and others from the United Kingdom, Germany, New Zealand and South America. Government and private search parties combed the region, but no further sightings were made. The tiger, as always, had escaped to its lair - a place that many insist exists only in the imagination. Others disagree. There have been more than 4,000 claimed sightings of the animal since supposedly died out, and the average number of claims reported to the authorities each year is now 150. So is it out there? Even experts differ in opinion.\n\nRandolph Rose, Associate Professor of Zoology at the University of Tasmania, says that he dreamed of seeing a thylacine, but is now convinced that his dream will go unfulfilled. The consensus among conservationists is that any animal with from the Australian mainland, so that Tasmania, a large island to the south of a population base of less than 1,000 headed for extinction within 60 years. Sixty years ago,' he says,' there was only one thylacine that we know of, and that was in Hobart Zoo. Take it from me, the tiger is gone.' But Dr David Pemberton, curator of zoology at the Tasmanian Museum states that, despite scientific thinking that a relatively large number of animals required to sustain a population the Florida panther is down to a dozen or so animals, and, while it does have some inbreeding problems, is still ticking along.' After all, animals can be notoriously elusive. The strange fish known as coelacanth, with its 'proto legs', was thought to have died out with the dinosaurs 700 million years ago until a specimen was dragged to the surface in a shark net off the coast of South Africa in 1938.\n\nWildlife biologist Nick Mooney has the unenviable task of investigating all so-called sightings of the tiger. It was Mooney who was first consulted in late February 2005 about the authenticity of new digital photographic images of a thylacine allegedly taken by a tourist. On the face value, Mooney says, this particular account of a sighting and the photographs submitted as proof amount to one of the most convincing cases for the species survival that he has seen. Many other sightings have been hoaxes, and many sincere seekers are victims of obsession. It is a blind optimism that something is, rather than a something isn't, Mooney says.' If something crosses the road, it's not a case of 'I wonder what that was?' Rather, it is a case of 'That's a thylacine!'\n\nHowever, Mooney treats sightings on face value.' I never try to embarrass people,' he says.... but the fact that I don't pack the car immediately after they telephone can taken as ridicule. Obsessive characters get angry that someone in my position is not out there when they think the thylacine is there.\n\nHans Naarding, whose sighting of a striped animal two decades ago was the highlight of a lifetime of animal spotting, remains puzzled by the time and money people waste on tiger searches. He says resources would be better applied to saving another endangered animal, the Tasmanian devil, and helping declining migratory bird populations. Could the thylacine still be out there?' Sure,' Naarding says 'I know the vast south-west wilderness of Tasmania well. They could survive... (But) if this is the case, it will not be long before they do disappear completely.' Naarding believes that any discovery of surviving thylacines would be rather pointless.' How do you bring a species back from extinction? He asks 'what could you do with it? If there are thylacines out there, they are better off right where they are.'",

          "instructions": "You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 28-40 which are based on Reading Passage below.",
          "text": "Paragraph A\nThe cane toad was introduced into Australia in 1935 to control sugar cane pests in Queensland. One hundred and one cane toads arrived at Edmonton in June in 1935. Breeding occurred almost immediately. The cane toad is tough and adaptable, as well as being poisonous throughout its life cycle, and has few predators in Australia.\n\nParagraph B\nCane toads are large heavily-built amphibians with dry, warty skin. They have a bony head and over their eyes are bony ridges that meet above the nose. They sit upright and move in short rapid hops. Their hind feet have leathery webbing between the toes and their front feet are unwebbed. Adult cane toads have large swellings - the parotoid glands - on each shoulder behind the eardrum. Cane toads may be grey, yellowish, olive-brown or reddish-brown, and their bellies are pale with dark mottling. Average-sized adults are ten to fifteen centimetres long. The largest female measured in Queensland was twenty-four centimetres long and weighed one point three kilograms. Male cane toads are smaller and wartier than females. During the breeding season males develop dark lumps (nuptial pads) on their first two fingers; these help them cling to a female while mating. Their mating call is a long loud purring trill. Cane toad spawn is exclusive in Australia. It is laid in long strings of transparent jelly enclosing double rows of black eggs. The spawn tangles in dense dark masses around water plants, and hangs in ropy strands if picked up.\n\nParagraph C\nThe natural range of cane toads extends from the southern United States to tropical South America. In 2002, cane toads occurred throughout the eastern and northern half of Queensland and have extended their range to the river catchments surrounding Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory. In New South Wales, they occur as far south as Yamba and Port Macquarie.\n\nParagraph D\nCane toads tolerate a broad range of environmental and climatic conditions and appear to be able to adjust and survive in almost any environment system, including sea water for short periods of time. This to a large extent explains their success in their spreading in Australia. Cane toads are found in environments ranging from sand dunes and coastal heath to the margins of rainforest and mangroves. They are most abundant in open clearings in urban areas, and in grassland and woodland.\n\nParagraph E\nCane toads eat almost anything they can swallow, including pet food, carrion and household scraps, but most of their food consists of living insects. Beetles, honey bees, ants, winged termites, crickets and bugs are eaten in abundance. Marine snails, smaller toads and native frogs, small snakes, and small mammals are occasionally eaten by cane toads. The tadpoles of cane toads eat algae and other aquatic plants which they rasp off with five rows of tiny peg-like teeth. They also filter organic matter from the water. Large tadpoles sometimes eat cane toad eggs.\n\nParagraph F\nCane toads were introduced to Australia to eat French's Cane Beetle and the Greyback Cane Beetle. The whitegrub larvae of these beetles eat the roots of sugar cane and kill or stunt the plants. The Australian Bureau of Sugar Experimental Stations imported about a hundred toads from Hawaii to the Meringa Experimental Station near Cairns. The toads bred quickly and more than three thousand were released in the sugar cane plantations of north Queensland in July 1935. At that time, some naturalists and scientists warned of the dangers of liberating cane toads in Australia. Their protests resulted in a brief moratorium on the release of toads, but releases resumed in 1936. The protestors were right. Firstly, cane toads compete for the resources of native animals, like food, which affects native populations. Secondly, cane toads don't have as many established predators as native animals and so their population grows quickly. Finally, some native animals who would normally feed on frogs try to eat toads and get poisoned.\n\nParagraph G\nAll stages of the cane toad's life-cycle are poisonous. No humans have died in Australia from cane toad poison, but overseas, people have died after eating toads and even soup made from boiled toad eggs. Cane toads are also poisonous to pets. In Hawaii, up to fifty dogs a year have died after having cane toads in their mouths. Signs of dogs being poisoned through ingestion include profuse salivation, twitching, vomiting, shallow breathing, and collapse of the hind limbs. Death may occur by cardiac arrest within fifteen minutes. A cane toad responds to threat by turning side-on so its parotoid glands are directed towards the attacker. The poison usually oozes out of the glands, but toads can squirt a fine spray for a short distance if they want. The poison is absorbed through mucous membranes such as eyes, mouth and nose, and in humans may cause intense pain, temporary blindness and inflammation.",
